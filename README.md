# MNIST Digit Classifier

This project is practice for creating a neural network from scratch. The project primarily uses the `Fastai` library. The model is a single layer network. The activation function used is a sigmoid to make the output of the network as 0 or 1 (digit 3 or 7).

## Installation

I use `Anaconda` for setting up environments, and `pip` as the package manager inside the environments. Just install the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you should be able to execute the notebooks. `mnist_model_from_scratch.ipynb` is the one you should try first to get a sense of the code. If you are not familiar with `Fastai` functions, checkout the [Fastai docs](https://docs.fast.ai/). `mnist_model_using_pytorch_func.ipynb` uses `Pytorch` library instead of `Fastai`.
